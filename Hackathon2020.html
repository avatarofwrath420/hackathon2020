            <p style = "text-align: center; font-size: 28px; padding-left: 400px">Covid-19, or the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2, is like most viruses:</p>
            <p style = "text-align: center; font-size: 28px; padding-left: 400px"> <b> It is capable of reproducing itself only though the entering of a host cell. It's makep consists of a lipid <br> shell dotted with protein spikes, holding its genetic material within. However, unlike its SARS counterpart, its spikes are 10 times more powerful, leading to a greater rate of transmission.<br><br> The Coronavirus spreads mainly through respiratory droplets, tiny particles of body fluid that have been aerosolized via sneezing or coughing. Surfaces stained with the virus take up to 3-4 days to sterilize. <br><br> Droplets exhaled at great force during exercise or vocal performace may spread further than 6 feet. The coronavirus can spread between pets and humans, though cross-transmissions occur at a lower rate than interspecies trasmission. <br><br> So far, the coronavirus has a mortality rate of ~1-2%, but may be higher for different people due to varying conditions. Infants and elders are especially susceptible to the Coronavirus.</b> <br>
